# ðŸ“‹ Requirements

Before starting, you'll need to have installed: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# ðŸŽ² Running Locally

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/GustavoGalo/interactive-card-details-form.git

# Change your directory in command line
cd interactive-card-details-form
```

Now we need install the dependencies, in this project i used [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but you are free to use npm

Running with yarn:

```bash
# Intall dependencies
yarn install

# Run start script
yarn start
```

Running with npm:

```bash
# Intall dependencies
npm install

# Run start script
npm start
```

After this, if everything went as expected, the [server](http://localhost:3000) is listening in port 3000
